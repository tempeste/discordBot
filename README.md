# Python Discord Music Bot

## Project Overview

This project centers on developing a versatile and engaging music player bot for Discord, with a focus on both entertainment and utility functionalities. The primary objectives of the project include:

- **Enhancing Python Programming Skills**: By creating and refining the bot, the project serves as a platform for refreshing and advancing Python programming capabilities, particularly in the realm of bot development.
  
- **Learning and Implementing DevOps Tools**: A key aspect of the project is to gain hands-on experience with various DevOps tools. This includes deploying and managing tools like Prometheus for monitoring, using Docker for containerization, and integrating CI/CD pipelines for streamlined development and deployment processes.

- **Self-Hosting on a Mini PC**: The bot is hosted on a mini PC, providing a compact and personalized hosting solution. This approach allows for direct management of the hosting environment and offers practical experience in server administration.

- **Utility Features for Palworld Server**: Expanding its functionality, the bot now includes features aimed at simplifying the administration and troubleshooting of the Palworld server.

## Current Progress

- **Operational Basic Bot**: The bot is currently functional within a Discord server, demonstrating basic operational capabilities.

- **Voice Channel Interaction**: The bot has the ability to join and leave voice channels, providing an interactive experience for server members.

- **External IP Address Reporting**: A crucial administrative feature of the bot is its ability to report the host machine's external IP address. This functionality is essential for the efficient administration and troubleshooting of the Palworld server, especially in the absence of a DDNS setup.
